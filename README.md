libgit2 discussions
===================

This project does not contain any code, but is for discussions
only via the creation of issues. The following list gives should
give you a feeling for topics which you raise in this repository:

- Overarching topics: topics which are not only relevant to a
  single project of the libgit2 group, but also to the other
  projects.
- Non-technical topics: everything that is not strictly technical
  but involves e.g. political discussions, agendas or similar
  things.
- Organization and coordination of events, meetings or dates.

On the other hand, all topics which are of technical nature and
not relevant to multiple projects at the same time should be
raised either as part of the core libgit2 repository or as part
of the respective bindings repository.
